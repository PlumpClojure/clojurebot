* Nov 3 2010
  - need a xmpp conduit to re-enable xmpp support
  - will have to unify xmpp and irc pipelines
* Nov 8 2010
  - real plugins, not developed in clojurebot
    - first attempt maybe agilezen (nice to have for work)
      - acutally maybe google plugin, since I have one in the
        clojurebot tree that works and it is super simple.
    - plugins need to be able to plugin into pipelines somehow
      - maybe a pipeline element that examines config and builds
        plugin pipes
    - how to load? if plugins live in a jar on the classpath, then not
      so nice for uberjar, can't just java -jar clojurebot.jar
      - maybe give path in config, and use urlclassloader to load.
      - look in jars, or ??
      - what about plugin's dependencies
* Nov 9 2010
  - put all jars in plugin directory in URLClassLoader, then load
    plugin namespaces from that.
  - actually, maybe first try at a new plugin will be a hudson BUILD
    IT NOW plugin
  - build it now plugin for hudson done
