Clojurebot v2

Version 2 of clojurebot is not yet very thoroughly tested; the sandbox is not enabled by default, and some knowledge of java security manager is needed to install an appropriate policy file. 

This version should have feature parity with v1 now.

Old clojurebot resides in branch 'clojurebotv1'
